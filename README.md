# sign-up-form

This project is part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS course of the Odin Project. As part of this project, I will
put into practice some of the new items and skills that I have learnt, including:

1. Form basics and browser-side validation
2. Tables
3. Imported fonts
4. Different CSS units
5. Practising using more advanced CSS selectors
6. Positioning (relative, absolute, sticky etc)
7. CSS functions and variables
8. CSS reset
9. SVG

It will be a sign up form for an website I will intend to make alongside ChromaMusic Community, which will be a more basic version of My Music Staff. This will also allow me to include better widgets and contact forms on the CMC website, as well as it making it easier for CMC staff, as it will be geared towards adult students.
